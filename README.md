CrazyLib
========

A mad lib interpreter.

Create madlibs by putting them into a text file with the needed input words
designated within <angle brackets>. To have a single input be put in multiple places put an id tag within the brackets as so: <example#1>. What follows the # is expected to be a unique number regardless of what precedes it. So, <this#1> will be replaced with the same word as <that#1>.
