CrazyLib
========

A mad lib interpreter.

Create madlibs by putting them into a text file with the needed input words
designated within &lt;angle brackets$gt;. To have a single input be put in multiple places put an id tag within the brackets as so: &lt;example#1$gt;. What follows the # is expected to be a unique number regardless of what precedes it. So, &lt;this#1$gt; will be replaced with the same word as &lt;that#1$gt;.
